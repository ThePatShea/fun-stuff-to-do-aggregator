# "Fun stuff to do" Aggregator

#### Product Description
This web app aggregates all the venues, deals, and events near your university and sorts them into 8 categories: cheap food, nightlife, arts, athletics, etc.

Students used the product to find fun things to do at their university and in the surrounding area.

#### Disclaimers
1. I made most of my commits on this repo using another Github account called "campus-bubble". This was the account I used back when I was still working with my old company. If you'd like to verify this, please contact Campus Bubble's Chief of Product, Giovanni Hobbins: giovanni@campusbubble.com

2. I built this web app when I was first learning how to make large products. I didnâ€™t understand the importance of using an MVC framework back then, so I invented my own structure. As a result, you may find it difficult to find your way around the directory structure. To see my more recent creations that utilize MVC and MV* frameworks, please visit these repos:

  - [Advanced Internal University Social Network](https://github.com/ThePatShea/advanced-internal-university-social-network)
